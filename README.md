# Serverless Notes App - Client
This is a demo of a serverless app based on the tutorial at [https://serverless-stack.com](https://serverless-stack.com).

This repo represents the client side of the app using create-react-app to scaffold and build the React app that hooks up to the [server-side API](https://github.com/the-nick-wilson/notes-app-api).
